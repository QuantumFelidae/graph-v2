### Issues
- [ ] Can't run tests in VS+WSL2 (they will run in VSCode, but is slow)
  - [ ] Submit a defect to MS?
- [ ] csv_parser
  - [ ] CSVReader doesn't conform to the C++20 input_range concept; can't define load functions properly
    - [ ] What's missing? const types; other?
  - [ ] leading & trailing spaces for quoted values aren't ignored
  - [ ] can it be reused for multi-pass?
  - [x] Fork: No response to issues submitted
- [ ] Are the CSR vertex & edge types different? (requirement of incidence and adjacency concepts)
- [ ] What is the best dynamic graph to propose for the std? vol, vov?
- [ ] Can an edgelist be trivially created by a user? (e.g. vector<pair<target_key,weight>>)
- [ ] If we have an access namespace, do we need a container namespace?
- [ ] Best way to extend vol_graph to support different container types?
  - [ ] template-template parameters?
  - [ ] container template arguments like stack/queue?
  - [ ] template specializations? (extension of current implementation)
- [ ] SG19 Input
  - [ ] Core data structures? static graph(CSR), dynamic graph (vol variant), edgelist graph
  - [ ] vertex_key or vertex_id?

  - [x] make it obvious it's unavailable for non-contiguous vertices
  - [x] Answer: for([ukey,u] : vertices(g))
