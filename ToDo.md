### Issues
- [ ] Can't run tests in VS+WSL2 (they will run in VSCode, but is slow)
  - [ ] Submit a defect to MS?
- [ ] csv_parser
  - [ ] CSVReader doesn't conform to the C++20 input_range or forward_range concepts; can't define load functions properly
    - [ ] What's missing? const types; other?
  - [ ] leading & trailing spaces for quoted values aren't ignored
  - [ ] can it be reused for multi-pass?
  - [x] Fork: No response to issues submitted
- [ ] Are the CSR vertex & edge types different? (requirement of incidence and adjacency concepts)
- [ ] If we have an access namespace, do we need a container namespace?
- [ ] SG19 Input
  - [ ] Core data structures? static graph(CSR), dynamic graph (vol variant)
  - [ ] vertex_key or vertex_id?
- [ ] Should operator\[\](n) -> vertex& be a requirement for a graph?
- [ ] Can std::array be used as a basis for a constexpr graph? What would the graph be?
- [ ] Does a LaTeX document take fewer pages than equivilent in Google Docs?
- [ ] SG19 Questions
  - [ ] key vs. id?
- [ ] Can CSR edges have a void value? (e.g. no v vector)
- [ ] How easy is it to write a view w/o the graph API?
- [ ] How to validate constexpr? (need to use std::array)
- [ ] CSR showed that there can be issues when an "edge" type is just an int, which is the same as the VKey. How to adapt existing graphs?
- [ ] Can transform_view be used in place of the projections in the graph views?
- [ ] How to support bipartite graphs using different vertex types?
  - [ ] Requires definition of 2+ types of vertices. How to define vertex type?
    - [ ] vertices are stored as a range of range of vertices, where the outer range is the type of vertex
  - [ ] Need proof-of-concept graph data structure to demonstrate
  - [ ] Option 1: extend API & Views with the type (or hidden if not used)
    - [ ] keeps uniformity of vertex type
    - [ ] may require use of variant for vertex_value type (having a unique value__type per vertex type significantly increases API complexity)
    - [ ] API extensions
      - [ ] vertices(g,type)
      - [ ] find_vertex(g,type,key)
      - [ ] vertex_type(g,u), or vertex_type(g,ui) (like vertex_key)
      - [ ] target_type(g,uv), source_type(g,uv), other_type(g,uv)
    - [ ] View exensions
      - [ ] vertex_view would need to include vertex type
      - [ ] edge_view would need to include target & source vertex type (with the key)
      - [ ] neighbor_view would need to include target vertex type
      - [ ] These extensions could be a template parameter based on the underlying type of graph; they would be absent if not needed
      - [ ] How to efficiently iterate through vertices of a specific type?
  - [ ] Option 2: use existing vertex_key to be a pair<vtx_type,vtx_key>
    - [ ] Can the existing design adapt to this? (Best option if it can be made to work)
    - [ ] keeps uniformity of vertex type
    - [ ] may require use of variant for vertex_value type
    - [ ] How well would it adapt to existing bipartite graphs?
  - [ ] Option 3: use C++ types to distinguish vertex types
    - [ ] invasive to the existing design and would make it significantly more complicated
    - [ ] would delay existing design by months and there's no guarantee to be successful
- [ ] Should we worry about row-major & column-major ordering of adjacency_matrix? always assume row-major?
- [ ] Do we need a run-time function to check for undirectedness, in addition to is_undirected_edge_v<EV>? Is it a run-time property for some graphs?
- [ ] Is there a way for EVF to take both edge_value and fnc obj? (same for VVF & vertex_value)
- [ ] The default for edges(g,ukey) CPO isn't being found by msvc or gcc

### Issues Resolved
- [x] vertex_key(g,u) now takes a vertex reference (not iterator)
  - [x] how to define vertex_key_t without calling vertex_key()? 
  - [x] make it obvious it's unavailable for non-contiguous vertices
  - [x] Answer: for([ukey,u] : vertices(g))
- [x] Best way to extend vol_graph to support different container types?
  - [x] Answer: graph_traits with template specializations for user-defined values. vol_graph renamed to dynamic_graph
- [x] What is the best dynamic graph to propose for the std? vol, vov? premature. Revisit later
- [x] Can an edgelist be trivially created by a user? (e.g. vector<pair<target_key,weight>>) yes; need to flush this out in paper
- [x] Can we drop the vertex_vertex_range in favor of just having vertexlist(g,u) [adjacency view]? yes
- [x] Can std::vector be used as a basis for a constexpr graph? No because we can't have variables of vector
- [x] Should CSR support source_key on edges (Sourced template parameter)? No. Views will be able to provide it so it won't be needed.
- [x] edge_list_graph (edgelist_edge<VKey,E,EV> view?): edgelist is a view, or projection of a container
- [x] Are there any issues with using tag_invoke? It appears not. Others are using it in papers.
