### Issues
- [ ] Can't run tests in VS+WSL2 (they will run in VSCode, but is slow)
  - [ ] Submit a defect to MS?
- [ ] csv_parser
  - [ ] CSVReader doesn't conform to the C++20 input_range or forward_range concepts; can't define load functions properly
    - [ ] What's missing? const types; other?
  - [ ] leading & trailing spaces for quoted values aren't ignored
  - [ ] can it be reused for multi-pass?
  - [x] Fork: No response to issues submitted
- [ ] Are the CSR vertex & edge types different? (requirement of incidence and adjacency concepts)
- [ ] If we have an access namespace, do we need a container namespace?
- [ ] SG19 Input
  - [ ] Core data structures? static graph(CSR), dynamic graph (vol variant)
  - [ ] vertex_key or vertex_id?
- [ ] Should operator\[\](n) -> vertex& be a requirement for a graph?
- [ ] Can std::array be used as a basis for a constexpr graph? What would the graph be?
- [ ] How are CPOs implemented for views in the standard (e.g. view::vertexlist for class & view::vertices for CPO)
  - [ ] Can tag_invoke still be used
- [ ] Does a LaTeX document take fewer pages than equivilent in Google Docs?
- [ ] SG19 Questions
  - [ ] key vs. id?
- [ ] Can CSR edges have a void value? (e.g. no v vector)
- [ ] How easy is it to write a view w/o the graph API?
- [ ] How to validate constexpr? (need to use std::array)
- [ ] CSR showed that there can be issues when an "edge" type is just an int, which is the same as the VKey. How to adapt existing graphs?

### Issues Resolved
- [x] vertex_key(g,u) now takes a vertex reference (not iterator)
  - [x] how to define vertex_key_t without calling vertex_key()? 
  - [x] make it obvious it's unavailable for non-contiguous vertices
  - [x] Answer: for([ukey,u] : vertices(g))
- [x] Best way to extend vol_graph to support different container types?
  - [x] Answer: graph_traits with template specializations for user-defined values. vol_graph renamed to dynamic_graph
- [x] What is the best dynamic graph to propose for the std? vol, vov? premature. Revisit later
- [x] Can an edgelist be trivially created by a user? (e.g. vector<pair<target_key,weight>>) yes; need to flush this out in paper
- [x] Can we drop the vertex_vertex_range in favor of just having vertexlist(g,u) [adjacency view]? yes
- [x] Can std::vector be used as a basis for a constexpr graph? No because we can't have variables of vector
- [x] Should CSR support source_key on edges (Sourced template parameter)? No. Views will be able to provide it so it won't be needed.
- [x] edge_list_graph (edgelist_edge<VKey,E,EV> view?): edgelist is a view, or projection of a container
