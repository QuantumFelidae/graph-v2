gcc requires views and their iterators to be default-constructible (cf bfs_vertex_range & bfs_edge_range)

P2300r5 4.19 parallel algorithms
:	In the future, we expect additional papers will propose asynchronous forms of the parallel algorithms 
	which (1) return senders rather than values or void and (2) where a customization point pairing a sender 
	with an execution policy would similarly be used to obtain an object of implementation-defined type to 
	be provided as the first argument to the algorithm.
