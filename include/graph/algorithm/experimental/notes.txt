BFS & DFS Experiment Using coroutines & visitors

Observations
1. Adding a visitor template argument means generating new code for each unique visitor (code bloat)

Questions
1. visitor: Is the optimizer smart enough to remove visitor calls that do nothing?
2. coroutines: Is it possible to optimize the "generator" so we don't have to have a look-ahead copy?
3. How to make values available to caller? distances[], depth[]
4. How to enable cancellation?

Benchmarking
1. coroutine: test with and without event flags (performance impact of reducing i/f complexity?)

Issues
1. co_dijkstra isn't passing the distance to vertices
